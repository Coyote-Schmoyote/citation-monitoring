This section presents the findings and analysis of the quarterly reports (January-March 2024).

- Number of mentions to EIGE (3.1);
- EIGEâ€™s output that has been referenced (3.2);
- Documents that have referenced EIGE (3.3);

st.markdown("""
In general, the number of mentions to EIGE (15) by academia seems limited when compared to the number of mentions to EIGE made by other institutions. However, due to the nature of the academic publications, the â€˜rhythmâ€™ of publishing in general is considerably slower and it is not possible to compare them with other type of publications that do not have such a lengthy and controlled procedure. 
The 15 citations identified correspond to 10 different articles, which means that most of them only include one citation to EIGE or EIGEâ€™s outputs.

Due to the nature of the academic publications monitored, it is not surprising to find that type of documents are all research articles (except for one report). For Q1 we have not identified any books or monographs.  
            
The academic publications have been prepared by 34 different authors. Most of them belong to different EU universities (except for one research institution in Mexico, and one in the United Kingdom). There are neither anyo repeated authors nor neither repeated universities.

For Q1 it is not possible to assess the impact factor of the journals that include citations to EIGE, as most of them have not been recorded on the tool that is used for allocating the impact factor, i.e. Scopus.
