While the impact metrics described above provide us with a micro view on the academic and social impact of the articles citing EIGE, it does not allow us to conduct a less granular analysis. To ensure comparability between the articles, we attributed a weight to each metric: 0,3 for number of citations, 0,2 for the impact factor and the altmetric, and 0,15 for location and category of the citation. These rankings will serve as a baseline, and will be used for trend comparison in future reports, as the monitoring team collects more data.
