Overall, the sentiment of all citations in 2024 was evaluated as positive. Furthermore, the majority of citations (34) were located in the body of the article, rather than just in the abstract.
The impact factor of the publishing journals for 2024 was not always publicly available. However, when available, most of the publishing journals (7) were classified  as journals with a high impact factor.

Figure 9 shows all the publications that include mentions to EIGE in 2024, organised by their allocated weight. 
Considering the allocated weights, the publications citing EIGE with the highest impact are the article titled “Evidence-based policy-making in normatively divided policy fields: European Institute for Gender Equality, Agency for Fundamental Rights and Slovak policies tackling violence against women” published on 31.10.2024 by a researcher from the University of Antwerpen, followed by the “Multidimensional domestic gender inequality and the global diffusion of women’s ministries, 1975–2015” published on 31.12.2024 by a researcher from the University Carlos III Madrid
