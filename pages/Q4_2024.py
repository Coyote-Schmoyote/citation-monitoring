Overall, the sentiment of all citations in Q4 2024 was evaluated as positive. Furthermore, the majority of citations (12) were located in the body of the article, rather than just in the abstract.
For Q4, the impact factor of the journals that include citations to EIGE was generally stronger than in previous quarters, with 4 mentions being published in journals with very strong impact factor, and 9 mentions unpublished in journals with strong impact factor. However, it was not possible to record the impact factor of seven out of thirteen journals, as they have not been recorded on the tool that is used for allocating the impact factor, i.e. Scopus.

Regarding the use of the citations to EIGE by social media, we have observed that while  X (formerly Twitter) remains the most frequent media used for citing EIGEâ€™s outputs in Q4 (30), there was more presence in other social media channels, such as Mendeley (14), and Bluesky (12).
